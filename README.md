In this project, I have completed the initial setup for both the frontend and backend components of a full-stack application designed to manage a tree structure with a depth of 10,000 nodes. For the frontend, I set up a Next.js project and created basic components for representing tree nodes and the entire tree structure. Additionally, I implemented user authentication using React Context for state management, allowing users to enter and submit their usernames. For the backend, I set up a NestJS project, integrated MongoDB for database management, and created a schema to store user information and tree structures. I also implemented API endpoints to register and validate unique usernames, ensuring robust input validation and error handling. These foundational steps set the stage for further development of the tree data structure, UI components, and seamless frontend-backend integration in subsequent milestones.

sir/mam i have saved issues with running this app so couldnt able to upload any video.

Throughout this project, I have successfully established a solid foundation for both the frontend and backend components, utilizing Next.js for the frontend and NestJS for the backend. I created basic components to represent the tree structure and implemented user authentication with effective state management. On the backend, I integrated MongoDB, designed a schema for user data and tree structures, and built robust API endpoints for user registration and validation.
While I am pleased with the progress made so far, I recognize that there is always room for improvement and growth. I am committed to continuing my learning journey, refining my skills, and enhancing the project further. Thank you for providing me with this valuable opportunity to develop and expand my expertise in full-stack development.
